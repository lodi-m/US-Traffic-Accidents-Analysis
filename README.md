# US-Traffic-Accidents-Analysis

This is an exploratory data analysis conducted on a dataset from the Contiguous United States. The dataset is continously being collected and currently contains information from 3 million traffic accidents. The data was collected using multiple Traffic APIs, such as MapQuest and Bing, and several other data providers.

Although this dataset can be used for a variety of applications, I will be focusing on how precipitation and other environmental factors impacted the accidents.
